This is a simple program that automatically places monkeys and starts. This is fully afk.

The resolution is 1366x768 and you will kind of have to move your screen around to fix it.

when using tiny task, go into the settings and click the continuous playback button then change the amount of times to a random number in the billions. Once done use ctrl+shift+alt+p to start and adjust your screen using the resolution 1366x768 and match the clicks torwards the buttons. This will take a couple of trys to get right but i promise it works if you use your brain.


i use tiny task for this. https://tinytask.net/
